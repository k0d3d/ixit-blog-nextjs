This is a blog app built using Next.js. 
The code is part of a post I wrote about 
How to convert a HTML Template to a Next.js blog connected to a CMS

The blog will also be a playground where I can test my apps and my efforts improving in 
the blockchain space. 

I plan to try out ideas like 
- Abitrage
- Simple Price Tickers
- Mint Posts as NFTs
- Selling NFT Collections which should music and file related.
- Using a Metamask or Eth address to unlock content.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
